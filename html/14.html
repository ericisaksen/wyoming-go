<p>When an agent offers insurance or financial products, they're not merely selling products, they're developing relationships. An agent's relationship with their customers, as well as the trust customers place both in the agent and in the products offered, are critical components of an agent's ultimate success. They meet with and know their clients on a personal level. The responsibilities of an agent include: contacting new people, meeting with them and fact-finding to gather necessary information regarding their present situation, providing analysis of situations, and, ultimately, presenting solutions that help meet objectives.</p>

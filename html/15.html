<p>At New York Life, we take sales training seriously. Even if agents don't have previous experience in selling, our multidimensional training program - NYLIC University - can point them to success. We'll also keep agents informed about the most sophisticated computer equipment and software packages.</p>
<p>Once theyâ€™re established in their careers, we offer ongoing workshops and programs to improve their knowledge of the business. Full-time management personnel and professional trainers are also there for support in each of our local offices.</p>

    <h3>Sales Training and Career Development</h3>
    <p>If an applicant is selected to join New York Life, they'll make a commitment to the company, but the company will also make a commitment to them. With New York Life, agents embark on a lifetime of learning and professional development through comprehensive training in insurance and financial services.</p>

    <p>Professional development occurs through NYLIC University. It's a program designed to train and develop agents throughout their sales careers. The first phase is Career Development School, during which agents will begin the process of getting their insurance licenses. Agents will receive a full introduction to products and selling skills, including how to develop a client base.</p>

    <p>After an initial six months of sales training, agents will spend two years in the Associate Program, an intensive experience that's focused on life insurance marketing, product selling, and technical knowledge. Upon completion, they'll be on their way to developing expertise in a selected area in the workplace or in the personal market, addressing individual needs.</p>

    <p>The next level of NYLIC University is the School of Professional Development, which offers specialized courses combining class instruction with self-study. New York Life strongly encourages its agents to make a commitment to lifetime learning. For this reason, the company provides tuition reimbursement to agents and Registered Representatives upon completion of certain industry courses.</p>

    <p>As a sales career develops, agents may wish to move into management. The company is structured to support them in reaching this goal. Many of today's senior executives began their careers as sales agents in the field.</p>

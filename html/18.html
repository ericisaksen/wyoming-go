She worked in businesses in hospitality, food, franchise, healthcare and more dedicating herself to learning as much as she could from each and every field and business owner. With this knowledge and experience, she truly understands what family-owned business owners priorities and goals are..</p><p>She is an avid volunteer, dedicated to giving back to her community in any way she can. In 2022 she logged 61 volunteer hours for The Salvation Army and participated in countless other local volunteer and fundraising activities. She hosts a local group for moms who are entrepreneurs called \"Momtrepreneurs\" that is focused on Gratitude, Growth, and Giving.</p><p>In her free time Madison loves to paint with her daughter and play Volleyball with her husband.

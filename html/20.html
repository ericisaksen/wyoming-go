I am passionate about helping you set up your financial future so that you can sleep better at night knowing your family will be taken care of if the worst happens.</p><p>I've worked for New York Life for a year, but have about five years past experience in insurance. My education is in the area of special education as I was a teacher for twelve years before embarking on a new career with New York Life shortly after losing my first husband at an early age.</p><p>I am newly married for the second time after losing my first husband suddenly four years ago. I live in the beautiful Black Hills of South Dakota where my closest neighbors are the deer. I love to fish, explore, travel and raise English Cream Golden Retrievers.</p>",

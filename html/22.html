      "bio": "<p>As a New York Life Agent, I sincerely believe that most people want to do what's right: right for themselves, right for their families, and right for their communities. In fact, that's one of the reasons I joined the company July 2022. After nine years working education field, I wanted the opportunity to work somewhere that made it easy for other people to do what was right, and more importantly, made it easy for me to do right by them.</p><p>You can take comfort in the fact that I have been a proud resident of South Dakota for most my life, and therefore have a vested interest in seeing my friends and neighbors succeed. As a loving husband and father of one daughter, I have many of the same hopes and aspirations as my clients and am happy to share with you all the resources and information New York Life has to offer.</p><p>Depending on your needs, I can introduce you to some ways to help protect your family's lifestyle and future; or prepare for major financial events such as paying for college, saving for retirement, or caring for an aging relative. If you're wondering about my qualifications, you might find it reassuring to know that I am a licensed agent to sell insurance through New York Life Insurance Company. In addition to my experience, I have a Masters from Fort Hays State University in Educational Administration and am currently working on getting designations such as CFP.</p>",

      <p>In 1867, as the Union Pacific Railroad laid track in what is now Wyoming, settlements sprang up along the route.  Within a year, residents of Cheyenne, the first railroad terminal town in the territory, were New York Life policy owners.</p>
      <p>The first Wyoming Death claim was on the life of William W. Harder, a 41-year-old lawyer who purchased a $5,000 endowment on May 2, 1868.  He died in Cheyenne less than five months later from typho-malarial fever and that amount was paid to his estate.</p>
      <p>A later claim was paid on the life of George A. Wellman, the 34-year-old foreman of a cattle ranch in Gillette.  He was murdered in Johnson County at the time of the cattle war in 1892.  Although he died one day before his policy was to be issued in New York, the $2,000 death benefit was paid to his widow, Lucy.</p>
